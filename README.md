## General info
<details>
<summary>Click here to see general information about <b>Project</b>!</summary>
It's very simple console project, which I made for practice, based on java basics, which I learned. It's mini banking application in which we can deposit, withdraw and transfer funds. 
I used very simple MVC pattern. I created NoMoneyException to handle exception, if funds are not sufficient for withdraw or transfer. In case of transfer of 10k amount and higher, tax office is informed automatically. 
For this functionality I used Observer pattern. I tried to use clean code in this project.
